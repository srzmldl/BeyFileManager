* Authentication
** introduction
  The OneDrive API uses the standard OAuth 2.0 authentication scheme to authenticate users and generate access tokens. You must provide an access token for every API call via one of the following.
  - An HTTP header: Authorization: bearer {token}
  - A query parameter: ?access_token={token}

** Authentication scopes
| Scope name         | Description                                                                                                                                                | Required |
|--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------|
| wl.signin          | Allows your application to take advantage of single sign-on capabilities.                                                                                  | No       |

** token code flow
   1) /Client/ requests an access token
   2) /Authorization end point/ grants access token
   3) /Client/ uses access token to make an API request
   4) /Client/ gets an API response
** e.g.
   - GET https://login.live.com/oauth20_authorize.srf?client_id={client_id}&scope={scope}
    &response_type=token&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}
     + 
   - https://login.live.com/oauth20_authorize.srf#access_token=EwC...EB
  &authentication_token=eyJ...3EM&token_type=bearer&expires_in=3600
  &scope=onedrive.readwrite&user_id=3626...1d
